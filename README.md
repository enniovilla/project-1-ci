## Design

### Website Structure

The website consists of 6 page website that the user can navigate via the navigation bar, being the Home page the default loading page. The logo is in the top left corner and the menu is in the top right corner. In the middle is the name Musical Theater Berlin, which is clickable and takes the user to the home page. This navigation bar on small screen devices ends up centralizing the three elements and the menu becomes a dropdown menu.

### Wireframes

Figma was the software I opted to create the wireframes. I created wireframes for mobile and desktop. Click on the button below to see them.

### Color Scheme

I wanted to play around with the colors a bit, so I chose to keep the navigation bar in a light color and the top part of the background always in a dark tone and the bottom part in a light tone, since the footer is in a dark tone, so I could have a nice contrast on the page and not irritating the user's eyes.

On the website I used a background image created in Canva in purple/dark blue with musical notes in grayish colors and on the pages where I didn't use this image, I used a gradient of the dark tone with the light tone, thus playing with colors going from the darkest to the lightest tone.

- I used the color `#FCDAD7` in the navigation bar.
- I used the color `#F05244` for the edges of the containers on every page of the website. This color also appears when the user hovers over the buttons and the posters on the main page.
- The gradient in the background when I didn't use the background image is made with the colors `#26174B` and `#FCDAD7`.
- The background image created on Canva has color `#26174B`.
- On the buttons I chose `#AB2D8` to be the color.
- The logo has three colors: `#F05244`, `#AB2D8` and `#5E276F`.

### Typography

The font I chose to use is [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) from Google Fonts and as a fall back font, sans-serif.

## Features and Future Features

### Features

This website includes 6 pages and all of them are responsive. They are: Home, About Us, Courses, Gallery, Contact and Sign Up. On each page we have:

- A favicon.<br>
![MTB favicon](documentation/favicon-browser.png)

- A navigation bar with clickable logo and names that will take the ser to the home page and the menu with sign up button highlighted to facilitate the user experience. If the user can scroll down, the navigation bar will be fixed at the top of the screen for easy access.

### The Home Page

On the home page the user will find the message **Sing! Dance! Act!** which clearly gives the idea of what the website is about. Below that the user will also find the poster of the upcoming courses, which are highlighted when hovering over them and are clickable, taking to the description of each course if clicked.

At the bottom of the page there are some cards with testimonials from former students and just below that a more recent youtube video of a piece from the school that doesn't autoplay.
