### Site Structure

The website consists of 6 page website that the user can navigate via the navigation bar, being the Home page the default loading page. The logo is in the top left corner and the menu is in the top right corner. In the middle is the name Musical Theatre Berlin, which is clickable and takes you to the home page. This navigation bar on small screen devices ends up centralizing the three elements and the menu becomes a dropdown menu.

### Wireframes

Figma was the software I opted to create the wireframes. I created wireframes for mobile and desktop. Click on the button below to see them.

### Color Scheme

I wanted to play around with the colors a bit, so I chose to keep the navigation bar in a light color and the top part of the background always in a dark tone and the bottom part in a light tone, since the footer is in a dark tone, so I could have a nice contrast on the page and not irritating the user's eyes.

On the website I used a background image created in Canvas in purple/dark blue with musical notes in grayish colors and on the pages where I didn't use this image, I used a gradient of the dark tone with the light tone, orange, thus playing with colors going from the darkest to the lightest tone.
