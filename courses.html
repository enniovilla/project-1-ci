                        <p>It’s 1962 in Baltimore, Maryland, and quirky, plus-sized, teenage Tracy Turnblad has one
                            dream:
                            to dance on "The Corny Collins Show". When she gets put in detention with the
                            African-American
                            students in the school, they teach her some of their dance moves, and her new found groove
                            wins
                            her a spot on Corny’s show. Overnight, Tracy transforms from a nobody into a star, and uses
                            her
                            newfound influence to advocate for racial integration on the television show. Tracy faces
                            scrutiny and bullying from the network producer, Velma, and her popular, but vicious,
                            daughter,
                            Amber. With the help of the teenage heartthrob Link, host Corny Collins, and Motormouth
                            Maybelle
                            (the host of "Negro Day" on Corny's show), Tracy overcomes the odds and succeeds in her
                            mission
                            to integrate "The Corny Collins Show". </p>
